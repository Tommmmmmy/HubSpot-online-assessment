# online-assessment
Show us what you can do! We've got a small project for you to complete that looks a lot like a task you might do on the job here.

You'll do an HTTP GET of some data in JSON format from one API endpoint, do some processing on it, and POST it back to another API endpoint. You can use whatever language you'd like.

There is no online coding environment or other restriction on how to work -- you complete the entire thing on your computer. Use libraries, your favorite IDE and debugger, and whatever else you would use while coding normally. There is no penalty for POSTing in an incorrect response and number of times as you iterate on a solution.
